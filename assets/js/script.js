//Using the frame work set up for us, we need to create rows that identify the hours of your day.
    //Set up hours starting at the beginning of your work day and a new hour each hour until your last hour of the day.
    //Within each hour, you should be able to input text in the main display for that hour and save it to local storage.
    //The current hour is highlighted Green (or some color), past hours should be grey (or some unique color), and upcoming hours should be red(or some unique color)

// A running clock should be operating in the background.
    //When the clock reaches a new hour, the current hour will move up
    // when the current hour moves up, the previous hour should grey, the current should green, the future should remain red

//Each hour should have a save button that will save the information of that one specific hour to local stoarge
    //If the user creates multiple hours of information but only saves for one of those hours, the other hours will not save
    //Maybe try to create a save all button that will save each hour of information.
